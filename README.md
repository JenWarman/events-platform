# EventsPlatform

## Project Overview 

A small community business has reached out to you to create a platform where they can create and share events with members of the community.

You have been tasked with building and hosting a platform (web app or progressive web app) that allows community members to view, sign up for, and add events to their own personal calendars. Staff members should have additional functionality to create and manage events.

## Project Objectives

- **Engage the user:** Easy search functionality and access to free art and cultural events throughout Nottingham. 
- **Ease of use:** The user can sign-up for a event with one click and add an event to their personal calendar.
- **Easy platform management:** An admin user can create, edit and delete events.

## Application Features

- **Event Search:** All users with or without an account can search for events by event type (e.g. music, theatre, etc) or using the search bar.
- **User Login:** Registered users can log in to sign up for events and access these events via their profile page. 
- **Google Calendar Integration:** Once a user has signed up for an event they will have the option to add this event to their personal calendar.
- **Staff Authorisation:** Admin users can manage events by adding new events, editing event details and deleting them.
